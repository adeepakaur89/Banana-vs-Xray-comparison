A Python visualization comparing natural “banana radiation” with medical X-ray exposure.

This project demonstrates how different types of radiation exposure compare on a simple, relatable scale. Using a clean bar graph and real radiation values, it shows:
	•	Bananas contain natural potassium-40, so they emit extremely tiny, harmless amounts of radiation.
	•	Chest X-rays are not radioactive, but they use ionizing radiation, leading to a higher dose.
	•	How many bananas would equal the dose of one chest X-ray?
→ About 1000 bananas!

The goal is to make radiation science easy, accurate, and non-scary using simple Python visualizations.

What’s Inside
	•	Python script to calculate banana radiation doses
	•	Dose comparison for 1, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 bananas
	•	Plot showing banana dose vs chest X-ray dose
	•	Uses matplotlib for clean, minimal visual output

Why This Project Matters

Most people think:
	•	“Radioactive = dangerous”
	•	“X-rays = radioactive”

Both are myths.

This project clarifies:
	•	Bananas → radioactive but harmless
	•	X-rays → not radioactive but ionizing, so the dose matters
	•	Radiation risk depends on type, energy, and exposure, not on fear
